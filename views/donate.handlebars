            <p>Hello! I'm Jecsham, the developer of this site.
                I made this website with the intention of collecting and offering useful
                MapleStory2 information for new and advanced users.
                Currently (and always) everyone can use all site features without any kind of
                cost, however, as is to be expected, maintaining this site is not free, that's why donations are
                welcome.<br>
                In addition, when you make a donation, you can leave me a note with your username, some message and a
                link üòè<br>
                <small class="text-muted">If your donation is up to $5 USD, the message and link will be placed at the top of the website*</small></p>
